# two-Sum
Code Explanation: Two Sum Problem - C++ Solution
Explanation:

Map Initialization:
A Map named m is initialized to store the complement and its corresponding index.

Iterating through Array:
The code uses a for loop to iterate through the array A.

target ko array ke pehle element se minus kr do and vo element find kro jo target ka addition ho
That's the whole logic behind it

Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n) - where n is the length of the array.
Space Complexity: O(n) - due to the Map storing at most n elements.
